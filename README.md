# Instagram
Exploratory data analysis of Instagram post performance to understand the relationship between reach, engagement quality, and follower growth.

## 🔍 Overview
On social media platforms, reach is often treated as a primary success metric.
However, high reach does not always translate into meaningful audience growth.

### This project performs an end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an Instagram post performance dataset to examine how reach, engagement quality, content strategy, and timing influence follower growth and post performance.

The analysis is focused on business decision-making, not prediction.

## 🎯 Objective

To answer a key growth question:
#### Does higher reach automatically lead to higher follower growth, or does engagement quality play a bigger role?

## 🧾 Dataset Description

1. Platform: Instagram (anonymised/simulated performance data)
2. Granularity: Post-level data
3. Each row represents a single Instagram post

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

1. Python
2. Pandas — data cleaning, aggregation, and analysis
3. Matplotlib & Seaborn — data visualisation

## 📊 Analysis Performed
🔹 Reach vs Follower Growth
🔹 Engagement Quality
🔹 Performance Bucket Analysis
🔹 Content & Format Strategy
🔹 Timing & Discovery

## 🧠 Key Insights

1. 🚫 High reach does not guarantee follower growth
2. ⭐ Engagement quality is a stronger growth driver than reach
3. 📉 Some high-reach posts generate shallow engagement
4. 📈 Moderately reached posts with strong engagement outperform
5. 🎯 Engagement rate is a more actionable optimisation metric
6. 🔁 Virality is influenced more by content and format than timing

## 📌 Business Takeaways

1) Optimise for engagement quality, not just exposure
2) Use reach as a discovery metric, not a success metric
3) Content strategy should prioritise relevance and interaction
4) Growth decisions should be data-driven, not assumption-based
